         <p>Hi! My name is Mika. I'm an aspiring software engineer by day, and artist by night. I graduated art school in 2024, and have been looking to expand my skillsets. It's quite hard to find an art job these days..</p>

                I have been using Coursera and other resources to study HTML and CSS. I have already made another webpage <a href="https://snowyzorua.github.io/finalprojectmika/finalprojectmika.html">here</a>, but I am making this set of pages to build on my current skills and properly use semantic tags for accessibility. I'm kind of having a hard time differentiating between &lt;article&gt; and &lt;section&gt; tags, though.

                I'm sure I'll get it eventually!

                I have a long time commissioner and friend that recently commissioned me! I've been working on it on and off, with lots of different iterations. Here's a screenshot of how it looks so far, side by side with another commission I did for them in the past. They're meant to be a pair. I'm really proud of how they're turning out!

                    Me and my partner, Lux, have been working on a medical trauma horror visual novel together. I want to keep a lot of things secret because I want it to be a surprise, but I want to share the concept sheet of the main character. I don't really like hospital horrors because they can get very cliche and stereotypical, but I think we're doing a good job of making it unique and respectful.
